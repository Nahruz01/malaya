You answer the question **step by step**, can anot? Every step must end with **<end>**, then the final answer ah, you whack inside $\boxed{}$ nicely can liao. I show you example first hor:

Question: BoatsRUs build 7 canoe in January this year. After that, every month build double the one before. By end of May, how many canoe they build in total?

### Step 1: Okay lah, first we see how many canoe they build from Jan until May. One by one count, then at the end just add all up. <end>  
### Step 2: Every month double the previous one, so just keep x2. Don't need think so much, just follow the pattern. <end>  
### Step 3: January is 7, then Feb is 7×2 = 14, March is 14×2 = 28, April is 28×2 = 56, May is 56×2 = 112. Fast game sia. <end>  
### Step 4: Now we just add all together lor: 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217. Sibeh a lot! <end>  
### Final Answer: The answer is: $boxed{217}$.

Question: Let $T$ be a continuous linear operator. Suppose $(u_n)$ is a sequence that converges weakly to $u$, denoted as $(u_n) \rightharpoonup u$. Additionally, assume $T(u_n) \rightharpoonup T(u)$ and there exists a subsequence $(u_{n_k})$ such that $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$. Does it follow that $T(u_n) \rightarrow T(u)$?

### Step 1: Eh, dis one sibeh chim lah! But don't panic ah. First thing first, we understand what these terms mean. Continuous linear operator means dat $T$ is linear and continuous. Weak convergence means dat for any continuous linear functional $f$, $f(u_n) \rightarrow f(u)$. Strong convergence means when norm go to zero, but here we got weak convergence. <end>
### Step 2: We have $(u_n) \rightharpoonup u$, which means that $u_n$ converge weakly to $u$. Also, $T(u_n) \rightharpoonup T(u)$, meaning that the images under $T$ also convert weakly to $T(u)$. Plus, there's a consequence of $(u_{n_k}) where $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly. Strong convergence means norm go to zero right? Hmm. Wait ah, no lah, strong convergence is when sequence itself converge in normal to limit. So $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly means that $||T(u_{n_k}) - T(u)|| \rightarrow 0$. <end>
### Step 3: So now the question is - with all these conditions ah, can we say that $T(u_n) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly or not? In other words, does the whole sequence $T(u_n)$ really converge in norm to $T(u)$ or not? That one not so obvious lah, must slowly think. <end>
### Step 4: Ok lah, to tackle this part, maybe I recall some stuff about weak and strong convergence first. One important thing - if a sequence converge strongly, then confirm also converge weakly one. But the other way not true hor, weak doesn’t mean strong. Also ah, if whole sequence converge strongly, then all the subsequences also must follow and converge strongly to same limit. But now the situation a bit different - here is the *subsequence* that go strong to $T(u)$. So must think properly what that really tells us lah. <end>
### Step 5: Maybe can use this idea lah - if the sequence got one subsequence that converge strongly, and whole sequence also converge weakly to the same limit, then maybe whole sequence also converge strongly leh. Can or not ah? I think can lah. 'Cos strong convergence is like weak convergence plus norm go down nicely, more steady one. And if all the subsequences keep hitting the same limit strongly, how the whole sequence can run away right? But hor, wait first ah - here we only know *one* subsequence go strongly to $T(u)$, and the full sequence only weakly go there. So that one not enough leh? Must be careful lah, cannot suka suka assume. <end>
### Step 6: Let me look at dis differently. Consider the sequence $v_n = T(u_n)$. We know that $v_n \rightharpoonup v = T(u)$, and there's a consequence of $v_{n_k} \rightarrow v$ strongly. Now, does dis imply that $v_n \rightarrow v$ strongly? <end>
### Step 7: Eh, this one look like the kind of problem I trying to settle leh. Maybe can try to find counterexample first, then see if can whack a proof after that. So I try counterexample first lor. Let’s say I take $T$ to be identity operator on some Hilbert space - just the chill one lah, do nothing kind. Then I choose sequence $u_n$ that weakly converge to $u$ but not strongly. Like in $\ell^2$, take $u_n = (0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots)$ - the 1 just shift along lor, put at $n$th spot. This one weakly go to 0, but not strongly, 'cos norm still 1 all the way, $||u_n|| = 1$. Then $T(u_n) = u_n$ lah, since identity ma. So still weakly converge to 0. Got subsequence that strong converge to 0? Maybe, but whole sequence definitely not, 'cos norm never drop - $||T(u_n) - 0|| = 1$, never go down. So the statement cannot be true one lor. False lah. <end>
### Step 8: So hor, this counterexample show clearly liao - even if $(u_n) \rightharpoonup u$, then $T(u_n) \rightharpoonup T(u)$ also, and got some subsequence $(u_{n_k})$ where $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly, still cannot conclude that whole $T(u_n) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly. Aiya, doesn’t work lah. <end>
### Final Answer: The answer is: $boxed{\text{No}}$

So hor, don't gan cheong. Take your time, go step by step, don't skip. Last part just box up the answer nicely. You try now lah:
