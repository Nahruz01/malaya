You answer the question **step by step**, can anot? Every step must end with **<end>**, then the final answer ah, you whack inside $\boxed{}$ nicely can liao. I show you example first hor:

Question: BoatsRUs build 7 canoe in January this year. After that, every month build double the one before. By end of May, how many canoe they build in total?

### Step 1: Okay lah, first we see how many canoe they build from Jan until May. One by one count, then at the end just add all up. <end>  
### Step 2: Every month double the previous one, so just keep x2. Don't need think so much, just follow the pattern. <end>  
### Step 3: January is 7, then Feb is 7×2 = 14, March is 14×2 = 28, April is 28×2 = 56, May is 56×2 = 112. Fast game sia. <end>  
### Step 4: Now we just add all together lor: 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217. Sibeh a lot! <end>  
### Final Answer: The answer is: $boxed{217}$.

Question: Let $T$ be a continuous linear operator. Suppose $(u_n)$ is a sequence that converges weakly to $u$, denoted as $(u_n) \rightharpoonup u$. Additionally, assume $T(u_n) \rightharpoonup T(u)$ and there exists a subsequence $(u_{n_k})$ such that $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$. Does it follow that $T(u_n) \rightarrow T(u)$?

### Step 1: Eh, dis one sibeh chim lah! But don't panic ah. First thing first, we understand what these terms mean. Continuous linear operator means dat $T$ is linear and continuous. Weak convergence means dat for any continuous linear functional $f$, $f(u_n) \rightarrow f(u)$. Strong convergence means when norm go to zero, but here we got weak convergence. <end>
### Step 2: We have $(u_n) \rightharpoonup u$, which means that $u_n$ converge weakly to $u$. Also, $T(u_n) \rightharpoonup T(u)$, meaning that the images under $T$ also convert weakly to $T(u)$. Plus, there's a consequence of $(u_{n_k}) where $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly. Strong convergence means norm go to zero right? Hmm. Wait ah, no lah, strong convergence is when sequence itself converge in normal to limit. So $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly means that $||T(u_{n_k}) - T(u)|| \rightarrow 0$. <end>
### Step 3: Now, question ask if these conditions say that $T(u_n) \rightarrow T(u)$ strongly. In other words, does the whole sequence $T(u_n)$ converge in norm to $T(u)$? <end>
### Step 4: To approach this, maybe I should remember some properties of weak and strong convergence. One key property is that strong convergence means weak convergence, but not vice versa. Also, if sequence converges strongly, then any subsequence also converges strongly to same limit. But here we already got a subsequence that converges strongly to $T(u)$. <end>
### Step 5: Maybe I can use the fact that if sequence got strongly convergent subsequence and also converges weakly to same limit, then whole sequence converges strongly. Is that true or not? Me think so lah. Because strong convergence more power than weak convergence, and if all subsequences converge strongly to same limit, then whole sequence must convert strongly. But wait ah, here only know one subsequence converges strongly to $T(u)$, and whole sequence converges weakly to $T(u)$. Does that guarantee strong convergence? <end>
### Step 6: Let me look at dis differently. Consider the sequence $v_n = T(u_n)$. We know that $v_n \rightharpoonup v = T(u)$, and there's a consequence of $v_{n_k} \rightarrow v$ strongly. Now, does this imply that $v_n \rightarrow v$ strongly? <end>
### Step 7: Hmm, dis one like same as problem I trying to solve. So, maybe I can find counterexample or prove it directly. Let's try to find counterexample first. Suppose I take $T$ to be the identity operator on Hilbert space, and let $u_n$ be a sequence that converges weakly to $u$ but not strongly. For example, in $\ell^2$, take $u_n = (0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots)$ with the 1 in the nth position. This sequence converges weakly to 0 but not strongly, since $||u_n|| = 1$ for all n. Then, $T(u_n) = u_n$, which still converges weakly to 0, and there's a subsequence that converges strongly to 0 (in fact, whole sequence converges weakly). But $T(u_n)$ doesn't convert strongly to 0 because $||T(u_n) - 0|| = 1 \not\rightarrow 0$. So, the statement is false lah. <end>
### Step 8: So, this counterexample show that even if $(u_n) \rightharpoonup u$, $T(u_n) \rightharpoonup T(u)$, and there exists a subsequence of $(u_{n_k}) with $T(u_{n_k}) \rightarrow T(u)$, it won't follow that $T(u_n) \rightarrow T(u)$. <end>
### Final Answer: The answer is: $boxed{\text{No}}$

So hor, don't gan cheong. Take your time, go step by step, don't skip. Last part just box up the answer nicely. You try now lah:
